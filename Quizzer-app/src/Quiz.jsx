  /**
   * I will not set up any comments for documentation in the return statement so it stays clean so here goes:
   ** The quiz is set up here, every single question shares the same styling and all but different values
   ** The shuffled answers array are recieved as props from the parent, mapped and rendered as the answer values
   ** The global checker state and the correct anwser prop is used to decide(in conditional classing) the added classes on the buttons to clarify their validity to the user
   ** The dimmed class is also a styling idea I added to make the selected answer(correct or no) stand out after a submission while the others are blurred
   ** The removeClick function removes the click feature after submission, this is on a condition if the checker state has been triggered
   * That's basically all that happens below I guessðŸ¥·
